* Dust trajectories in bow shocks
This is an extension of the models I have done in ~dust-wave.org~ from the Jorge bow shock project. 
+ 1d and 3d models for the trajectories of charged dust grains under 3 forces
  1. Radiation from a star
  2. Gas-grain drag
     - Stokes drag (solid body), important at supersonic relative speeds
     - Coulomb drag, peaks at roughly 10 km/s for ionized gas
  3. Lorentz force, couples grains to B-field
+ Main scenario considered is a stream of dusty plasma, incident on a star


* Drag force
+ Functional form from Draine & Salpeter
+ Calibrated from Cloudy models
  + Major contribution is from protons
  + But does include the minor contribution from electrons and helium ions
+ Stokes drag (solid body)
